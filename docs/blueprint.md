Below that is an image grid of all the plants collected. You can tap once on the thumbnail to view fun information or hold down to enter a watering mini game. Eventually plants will change form after a certain amount of watering. All planted will be collected at base form.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Gradient from a vibrant green (#90EE90) to a pure white (#FFFFFF) to give a fresh and inviting feel.
- Primary Color: Earthy brown (#8B4513) as a reference to planters, pots, and other growing implements.
- Accent Color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), placed roughly 30 degrees away from brown on the color wheel, suggesting floral, fresh growth.
- Font Pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings and shorter texts with 'Alegreya' (serif) for longer informative texts.
- Icons: Use plant-themed icons in a hand-drawn, simple style for navigation and interaction elements. Ensure each icon is distinct and easily recognizable.
- Employ a grid-based layout to organize plants in the room view. Use clear, intuitive navigation for main sections, like home, room, and profile.
- Subtle watering effects during the mini-game, transition animations between the loading screen and home screen. Transitions when drawing a new plant.
- On the splash screen the logo and "tap to enter" should be animated
- The settings page will contain sliders with on/off toggles to control the sound and fx
- The splash screen should have the same green to white gradient as the reference
